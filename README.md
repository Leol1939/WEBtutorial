# Story:
You play as a new recurit being trained as website inspector for the Website Efficancy Bureau, an underground organisation fighting computer viruses and other forms of threats on the internet. Over the course of the game you face three main rounds varying in challange while being hosted by senior website inspector Pascal.

# General Information:
The game is 5 minutes long and includes mature themes and violent imagery for comedic purposes.

As the game is intended to run regularly on an internet browser for my online computer site hopping game I have just exported the game as a share link to be played on Makecode Arcade. In the future it will be embeded within the webpage of the WEB website for my game.

Within Makecode arcade I predomiantly used Javascript coding and block based coding.

# Project status: 
Complete but can be touched up after assesement.
